This is a dummy tool to activate on http2debug=2 setting in a remote golang process on the fly while it is running.
(Think about greybox testing.)

Example:
Spin up an HTTP/2 server by following this guide:

https://posener.github.io/http2/

Start it, then run:

```
 ./go-http2-verbose.sh $(pidof h2server)
```

Then send an example request:

```
curl --http2-prior-knowledge --http2 https://127.0.0.1:8000/foo -v -k
```

On the stderr of the server application, lines like this will show up:

```
2021/08/13 09:16:36 http2: decoded hpack field header field ":method" = "GET"
2021/08/13 09:16:36 http2: decoded hpack field header field ":path" = "/foo"
2021/08/13 09:16:36 http2: decoded hpack field header field ":scheme" = "https"
2021/08/13 09:16:36 http2: decoded hpack field header field ":authority" = "127.0.0.1:8000"
2021/08/13 09:16:36 http2: decoded hpack field header field "user-agent" = "curl/7.68.0"
2021/08/13 09:16:36 http2: decoded hpack field header field "accept" = "*/*"
```

If your target is a go-grpc server, use the `go-xhttp2-verbose.sh` script instead
(as the underlying h2 implementation of go-grpc is coming from golang.org/x/net/http2
and does not use the language built-in.)

If you are targeting a Google binary, you may need to override the package like this:

```
PACKAGE=google3/third_party/golang/go_net/http2/http2 ./go-xhttp2-verbose.sh $(pidof worker_main)
```

The other script, `remote-setenv.sh` can be used to set an environment variable in a remote process
on the fly. Calling it with `GODEBUG http2debug=2` would not work, as this envvar is processed early
in a package initializer of `net/http`. 

(Remark, runtime changes of environment variables don't reflect in `/proc/<pid>/environË™.)
